**A custom responsive grid system (WIP)**

Made a custom grid system. Navbar and header are styled accordingly. 

To use the gird system, simply copy the code in stylesheets/flex.css and stylesheets/flex.css.

flex.css contains styles for the grid system, navbar and header. More css elements to be added.

**How the grid is used?**

Grids are created by simply dividing the page into 12 columns. To divide the page into two, simply you need a 12/2 = 6 size grids. Therefore, a class col-6-0f-12 is being used together with another class col-6-of-12, that makes it 12 columns total. 

To make a 3 column page, you will need a 3 col-4-of-12 to make it a total of 12 and so on for the number of colmuns you need. THe columns **MUST** add to 12. 6 + 6, 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, 12 x 1, 4 + 8, 10 + 2, etc. 

Report any bugs if you see one. Thank you.
